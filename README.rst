Cookiecutter Qiita Plugin Template
==================================

`Cookiecutter <https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter>`__ template for a
`Qiita <https://github.com/biocore/qiita/>`__ plugin.

This template sets up the skeleton code to create a Qiita plugin.

Getting Started
---------------

To create your own Qiita plugin, first install Cookiecutter:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install -U cookiecutter

Then, generate the skeleton of the plugin by running cookiecutter (it will
create the skeleton in the current directory):

.. code-block:: bash

    $ cookiecutter https://github.com/qiita-spots/qp-template-cookiecutter

You'll be prompted to introduce values so cookiecutter can set up the skeleton
correctly. You can introduce new values or just hit enter to use the default
values. Any of these values can be manually changed through the code:

- ``project_name``: This is the name of your project. It will be added on the project ``README.rst`` file and the ``setup.py`` file. ``Qiita Plugin`` is appended to the project name. We highly recommend to not use the default value.
- ``repo_name``: The github repository name. The default value is generated by lowercasing the ``project_name`` value and changing spaces by ``-``.
- ``organization_name``: The github organization name in which the repository will live.
- ``module_name``: The name of the module. The default value is generated by replacing the ``-`` characters in the ``repo_name`` value by ``_``.
- ``author``: The name of the plugin author
- ``email``: The email to contact the plugin author
- ``URL``: The URL of the project. The default value is generated using the ``organization_name`` and ``repo_name`` values.
- ``license``: The license of the project. Choose between BSD 3-clause, MIT or Apache. Default is BSD 3-clause.

Example:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ cookiecutter /Users/jose/qiime_software/qp-template-cookiecutter/
    project_name [New Plugin]: Target Gene
    repo_name [qp-target-gene]:
    organization_name [qiita-spots]:
    module_name [qp_target_gene]:
    author [Qiita development team]:
    email [qiita.help@gmail.com]:
    URL [https://github.com/qiita-spots/qp-target-gene]:
    Select license:
    1 - BSD 3-clause License
    2 - MIT License
    3 - Apache Software License 2.0
    Choose from 1, 2, 3 [1]:


Cookiecutter will create a directory using the ``repo_name`` value in the
current directory. The generated skeleton takes care of most of the initial
plugin setup and Qiita communication, as well as common repository set up,
including travis and coverage. As a plugin developer, you need to enable
travis and coverage to be correctly reported. Under the ``repo_name`` you can
add as many submodules as you need to implement your functionality.
Additionally, you will need to complete the TODO marked sections in the code.
Follow the instructions within the comments. The following list contains a
general overview of what's required in those TODO sections:

- File ``README.rst``: Add a description of the commands added by the plugin
- File ``module_name/__init__.py``: Create the QiitaCommands and register them to the plugin.
- Create your own module files with the functions executing the actual commands and the tests for those functions.

Once all the TODO's are completed, your can upload your code to github and see
the tests run (if travis and coveralls are enabled).
